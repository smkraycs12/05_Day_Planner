# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

I created a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. The planner is in military time because it the time format that I use at my place of employment.
